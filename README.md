# Interactive Home Lighting System with Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 ðŸ’¡

---

This product is designed to develop a more **aesthetically pleasing** and **interactive lighting controller**. The larger external casing makes it more accessible for **visually impaired users**, allowing them to easily locate the controller and enhancing safety when searching for the light switch. The pressure sensors are fixed in specific positions, ensuring **stable and consistent control**. As development progresses, the enclosure design will also be refined for improved appearance.

## Working Principle

This prototype operates by receiving input data from **switches** and **pressure sensors**, which are transmitted to the **Arduino MKR WiFi 1010** through data lines.  
The Arduino processes these signals to determine user actions â€” such as turning lights on/off, adjusting brightness, or switching lighting modes â€” and then sends corresponding commands via **MQTT** to control the **Vespera** lighting system remotely.  

This setup enables real-time, interactive control between physical input components and the digital lighting interface.

## Control Method 

---

The system consists of **two switches** and **two pressure sensors**:

- **One switch** serves as the **main power control** â€” pressing it will turn off the lights immediately, regardless of the current lighting mode.
- **The second switch** is used to cycle through **six preset lighting modes**, including:

  1. **Reading Mode** â€“ Bright cool white  
  2. **Relax Mode** â€“ Warm amber tone  
  3. **Movie Mode** â€“ Dim blue light  
  4. **Sunrise Mode** â€“ Gradual warm-to-white transition  
  5. **Party Mode** â€“ Fast-changing random colors  
  6. **Night Light Mode** â€“ Soft dim orange for nighttime use  

The pressure sensors detect the **strength of the press** â€” the harder the press, the brighter the light. To avoid accidental activation, the brightness adjustment is triggered **only when both pressure sensors are pressed simultaneously**.

## Future Development

In future iterations, the prototype may adopt a **more universal connection interface** to support a wider range of lighting systems.  
The **enclosure design** will also be refined to improve **aesthetic quality** and **user experience**, making it more suitable for various home environments.  
Additionally, the **pressure sensors** could be upgraded to **more advanced, accurate, and user-friendly versions**, further enhancing interaction precision and comfort.
